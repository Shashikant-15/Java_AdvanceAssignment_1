/**
 * This program lets the user keep a persistent "phone book" that
 * contains names and phone numbers.  The data for the phone book
 * is stored in a file in the user's home directory.

 * The program is meant only as a demonstration of file use.  The phone
 * book data is stored is the form of Name/Number pairs, with
 * little error checking.  In particular, the "phone directory"
 * used in this program is not even close to what would be needed for
 * a real phone book application.
